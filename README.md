### 1.1 Hypothesis
Hypothesis: "For the brain tumor classification dataset, 
a Neural Network model will outperform K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
in terms of classification accuracy due to its ability to capture complex patterns in the data. 
However, KNN might be more efficient for small datasets, 
and SVM may offer a balance between interpretability and performance."


# Algorithm Comparison and Performance Analysis

The goal of this project is to understand various machine learning algorithms and techniques by experimenting with them and comparing their performance empirically under a variety of circumstances. Instead of focusing solely on implementing each algorithm, I am primarily focused on exploring their behavior through experimentation and analysis.

## Algorithms Implemented and Tested

### Neural Networks
Using networks of nodes with customizable layers and activation functions. I am experimenting with different architectures and activation functions to assess their impact on performance.

### Support Vector Machines
Using at least two different kernel functions (e.g., linear and radial basis function) to compare how the choice of kernel influences the algorithm's accuracy.

### k-Nearest Neighbors
Testing the algorithm with significant values of `k` to explore how varying the number of neighbors affects classification accuracy and model generalization.

### Boosting for Decision Trees (Extra)
In addition to the above algorithms, I will also implement a Boosting technique (such as AdaBoost) applied to Decision Trees, comparing its performance against the other models.

## Experimentation Process

### Classification Problem
I am tackling a classification problem that I find particularly interesting due to its complexity and the potential insights that can be drawn from the data. I will add detailed descriptions of the classification problem and explain why it is compelling.

### Performance Evaluation
For each algorithm, I am measuring the following metrics:
- **Training and Testing Error Rates**: I will present these rates for each algorithm on the classification problems.
- **Learning Curves**: At the very least, I will include graphs that show performance on both training and test data as a function of training size. For algorithms that involve iterations (e.g., Neural Networks), I will also plot error rates as a function of the number of iterations.
  
### Results and Analysis
- **Comparison of Algorithms**: I will compare and contrast the performance of each algorithm, explaining why I obtained the results that I did.
- **Hypothesis and Improvements**: I will formulate a hypothesis about the datasets and the algorithms' performance. Additionally, I will suggest potential changes to the algorithms to improve their performance.

### Graphs
- I will include graphs for each algorithm showing training and testing error rates as a function of both training size and iterations (for iterative algorithms).
- These learning curves will help visualize the models' generalization capabilities and provide insight into their strengths and weaknesses.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide a deeper understanding of the algorithms by comparing their empirical performance. Through analysis of the results, I will draw conclusions about how each algorithm behaves and propose future improvements.
